Analyze the package whose source code is located at the local path `dir`.  If

GitHub authentication, wait for `sleep` seconds before collecting the list of
its contributors.

`only_subdir` indicates that while the package's code does live in a subdirectory of the repo,
`dir` points only to that code and we do not have access to the top-level code. We still pass non-empty `subdir`
in this case, to record the fact that the package does indeed live in a subdirectory.

Pass `version` to store the associated version number. Since this call only has access to files on disk, it does not
know the associated version number in any registry.

    analyze_path!(dest::AbstractString, repo::AbstractString; name="", uuid=UUID(UInt128(0)), subdir="", auth=github_auth(), sleep=0, tree_hash=nothing) -> Package

Analyze the Julia package located at the URL given by `repo` by cloning it to `dest`
and calling `analyze_path(dest)`. If `tree_hash !== nothing`, only the code associated
to that tree hash is placed into `dest`. That allows analyzing particular version numbers,
but in the case of packages in subdirectories, it also means that top-level information
(like CI workflows) is unavailable.

If the clone fails, it returns a `Package` with `reachable=false`. If a `name` and `uuid` are provided,
these are used to populate the corresponding fields of the `Package`. If the clone succeeds, the `name`
and `uuid` are taken instead from the Project.toml in the package itself, and the values passed here
are ignored.

If the GitHub authentication `auth` is non-anonymous and the repository is on
GitHub, the list of contributors to the repository is also collected, after
waiting for `sleep` seconds for each entry.  See
[`PackageAnalyzer.github_auth`](@ref) to obtain a GitHub authentication.
